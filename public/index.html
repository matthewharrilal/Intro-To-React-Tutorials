//      // So once this button is clicked the onClick event handler and due to that affect the event handler calls this.props.onClick where the squares props were defined in Board and we are getting those properties once we call the render square function and once we get those properties what we are doing with them is that we are

    squares[i] = this.state.xIsNext ? 'X' : 'O';
